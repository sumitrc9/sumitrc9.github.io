	<h1>Socio-Economic Impact</h1>

	<p>
		The introduction of autonomous vehicles will have a profound impact on several social and economic spheres.

		Autonomous vehicles can prove to be more enviornmentally friendly and better for overall public health. 

		Self-driving cars have been explored as robotaxis which can promote ride-sharing as well.

		Additioanlly, self-driving vehicles also emanate futuristic vibes in the cities where thay are being used. 

		They are more efficient and promote productivity. 


		The introduction of a new technology such as autonomous vehicles calls for a substantial change to the way individuals interact with their surroundings. New technologies have the potential to exert influence on many sectors such as public opinion, popular trends, and the economy. As such is the case, it is clear that a revolutionary technology, like autonomous vehicles, is likely to have a variety of stakeholders. Among these stakeholders are the users of self-driving cars, the companies that will produce and distribute them, and policy makers who will need to make dynamic changes to regulations as autonomous vehicles are adopted by the general public.


		The primary stakeholder of self-driving cars are the people who are going to use them. In many countries, driving is a popular means of transportation. However, driving in a traditional sense has several flaws. In a survey asking about the benefits of self-driving cars, 76% of respondents highlighted accident prevention and 66% mentioned an improvement in accessibility for elderly and disabled people [1]. Autonomous vehicles remove the number one cause of all car accidents: the driver. Estimates show that self-driving cars have the potential to reduce accidents by 94% [2]. This drastic improvement to safety has become the primary justification behind the introduction of autonomous vehicles.  Another problem with the traditional car is its inconvenience for people with limited accessibility. Self-driving cars can open a gateway of opportunities for people who are restricted by traditional cars. It is projected that self-driving cars can have a customer base that is 20% larger than traditional cars due to improvements in accessibility [2]. Another positive impact that autonomous vehicles pose to the consumer is an increase in overall individual productivity. Driving is one of the most mundane tasks, and commuting has been indicated by several stakeholders as an inefficient use of time [1]. Self-driving cars will give a significant amount of time back to the user allowing for him or her to be substantially more productive. 

		Another stakeholder for autonomous vehicles are the companies that are currently developing this technology. One positive impact for companies such as Tesla, Uber, and Google is that it will give them a futuristic vibe. Oftentimes, investors are more likely to invest in companies that are building technologies for the future. A second positive impact for companies is a general productivity increase among employees. Workers are more productive when they do not have a frustrating commute [3]. Self-driving cars are also more likely to keep workers safe. As driving becomes progressively redundant, increases in productivity as a result of this new technology are bound to bring positive changes. On the other hand, one negative impact of autonomous vehicles towards companies is a labor trade-off. For example, by shifting towards autonomous vehicles, companies such as Uber would have to modify their entire business model. In a survey, 42% of surveyors thought job loss was a serious concern raised by autonomous vehicles [1]. Another negative impact of self-driving cars for companies is an increase in liability concerns. Previously, most of the responsibility in a driving incident would fall on the driver. With self driving cars, corporate leaders, engineers, and designers will become increasingly more responsible for any faults found in the technology.
